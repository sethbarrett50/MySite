    Hello, my name is Seth Barrett. I currently attend Augusta University seeking a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and am in my junior year. I am from Peachtree Corners, Georgia which is a suburb outside of Atlanta. I am an Eagle Scout, and enjoy working with or leading others towards a common objective.

  <h3>About me </h3>
  <p> 
    When I was a freshman in highschool, I would go with my church group to the local food bank and play with the kids of the parents waiting for assistance. Their joy taught me to make the most of my situation and perservere no matter what adversity I might face.
  </p>
  <p> 
  After I graduate college, I plan to pursue a career in a field of computer science. I have not decided which field yet, as I would like to try and take some of my upper level classes and decide from there.
